# Project-11---Hotel-Booking-Reservation

Objective: The objective of analyzing this data is to gain insights and understand the patterns related to hotel booking. By exploring the data, we aim to identify factors that influence hotel cancellations, booking status, and average room prices. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of various features such as lead time, arrival date, market segment, and meal plans on the success of a booking. This analysis will help us make informed decisions and improve the hotelâ€™s booking process and customer experience. 

Hypothesis 1: Lead time VS Booking Status
Null Hypothesis: Lead time (the number of days between booking & arrival) has no significant impact on the booking status (canceled or not canceled)
Alternative Hypothesis: Lead time affects the booking status, and bookings with longer lead times are less likely to be canceled

Hypothesis 2: Market Segment VS Average Room Price
Null Hypothesis: The market segment type has no significant impact on the average room price
Alternative hypothesis: Different market segments may lead to variations in average room price

Hypothesis 3: Arrival Month VS Number of Bookings
Null Hypothesis: The arrival month does not influence the number of bookings
Alternative Hypothesis: Certain months may see higher booking numbers in comparison to the others

Hypothesis 4: Type of meal plan VS Number of Special Requests
Null Hypothesis: The type of meal plan selected has no effect on the number of special requests made by guests
Alternative Hypothesis: Different meal plan choices may lead to varying numbers of special requests from guests

Hypothesis 5: Room Type Reserved VS Number of weekend nights
Null Hypothesis: The room type reserved does not impact the number of weekend nights booked
Alternative Hypothesis: Certain room types may attractmore weekend night stays compared to others
